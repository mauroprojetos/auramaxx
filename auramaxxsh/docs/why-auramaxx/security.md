# Security

This document explains the current runtime security model and how enforcement works in practice.  
Read this before changing auth, token policy, or credential access behavior.

## Security Overview (why the model is safe)

AuraMaxx uses a **three-layer model**:

1. **Profile-based issuance** (how a token is created)
2. **Permission-based runtime enforcement** (what a token can do)
3. **Granular credential access policy** (which secrets and fields can be touched)

The result: tokens are easy to issue, strict to scope, and hard to overscope.

### The model in one pass

- Agents usually start with an **agent profile** (`POST /auth`) that defines:
  - base permissions
  - credential read/write scopes (agents/tags/ids)
  - TTL and read limits
  - field redaction policies
- Issuance is intentionally **human-approved** and not self-service by default.
- Every API request is still validated again using runtime permission checks.
- Secret access is additionally constrained by selector checks and read budgets.
- Tokens are short-lived and can be revoked proactively.

### What “least privilege” means here

- Profiles give sensible defaults, but they are not blanket trust.
- Every request is still gated by permissions + scope.
- Agent callers can only operate on explicitly authorized agents and fields.
- If a profile must be tighter, overrides must be **tighten-only**.

## Core Principles

1. **Memory-rooted auth/session state** — in-memory SIGNING_KEY, sessions, and revocation state drive runtime trust boundaries.
2. **Restart invalidates all tokens** — new SIGNING_KEY is generated each restart.
3. **Minimal permissions** — tokens carry exactly the permissions needed.
4. **Encrypted secrets at rest** — credential fields are encrypted in local DB with agent-derived keys.
5. **Encrypted credential transport** — secret reads are encrypted to the caller's RSA pubkey.
6. **Human-controlled unlocks** — privileged operations require explicit human action.
7. **Scoped ownership** — credential access requires explicit credential selectors + permission checks.

## Current Security Model

AuraMaxx is **profile-first** for issuance, but **permission- and scope-enforced at runtime**.

- Issuance determines token payload (permissions, TTL, credential selectors, exclusions).
- Middleware enforces per-route permissions on every call.
- Credential read/write governance adds extra controls:
  - selector checks
  - per-token read budgets
  - max read/window throttles
  - excluded field minimization

Auth/session truth source is still memory-first:

- Tokens are signed in memory (`SIGNING_KEY`).
- Session counters/tracking are memory-backed.
- Revocations are memory-backed (`revokedTokens`).
- DB is authoritative for UI/audit views, not for runtime auth decisions.

## Agent Token Paths

> For quickstart usage and CLI examples, see [AUTH.md](../ai-agents-workflow/AUTH.md). This section describes the security enforcement model for each path.

### 1) `POST /auth` (profile-only request + human approval)

Standard agent onboarding path.

- Required: `agentId`, `profile`, `pubkey`.
- Rejects raw issuance (`permissions`, `ttl`, `credentialAccess`) on `/auth`.
- Resolves profile policy and stores approval request in memory.
- After approval, claim via `GET /auth/:requestId` with header `x-aura-claim-secret`.

### 2) `POST /actions/token` (admin direct issuance)

Admin-only endpoint with XOR mode:

- `profile` mode: profile + optional tighten-only overrides
- `permissions` mode: explicit permissions

Exactly one mode must be supplied.

### 3) Validation and revocation

- `POST /auth/validate` validates token status, expiry, and revocation.
- `POST /actions/tokens/revoke` forcibly removes active token trust.

## Canonical Approval Challenge Flow (CLI + MCP)

This section defines the required security contract for approval-required operations across CLI and MCP surfaces.

### Canonical sequence

All approval-required operations must follow one deterministic sequence:

1. Request returns an approval-required payload.
2. Human approves at `approveUrl`.
3. Agent executes typed `claimAction`.
4. Agent executes typed `retryAction`.

All canonical escalation envelopes must include `contractVersion: "v1"`.

No agent-facing retry command/tool should require passing `secret`.

### Single identifier

- Use `reqId` as the only challenge identifier.
- Do not introduce a separate challenge id for retry routing.
- `reqId` is the binding key for claim context and one-shot token selection.

### Required approval-required payload

Every approval-required response must include:

- `requiresHumanApproval: true`
- `reqId`
- `approvalScope`: `one_shot_read` or `session_token`
- `approveUrl`
- `claimAction` (typed, transport-aware)
- `retryAction` (typed, transport-aware)
- `instructions` (explicit ordered steps with exact next actions)

Recommended claim status payload fields (for deterministic agent branching):

- `claimStatus`: `pending` | `approved` | `rejected` | `expired`
- `retryReady`: boolean

### Typed action contract

Both `claimAction` and `retryAction` must be transport-aware:

- `action.transport`: `"cli"` | `"mcp"`
- `action.kind`: `"command"` | `"tool"`
- CLI form uses `action.command` (exact command string)
- MCP form uses `action.tool` + `action.args`

Agent behavior requirement:

- Execute typed actions exactly as provided.
- Do not reinterpret or invent alternate action paths.

### Hidden context model keyed by `reqId`

`secret` and key context must be stored out-of-band and never required in retry calls.

CLI storage requirements:

- Short-TTL secure local state with file mode `0600`
- Map `reqId -> { secret, keyRef, scope, expiry, retryMeta }`

MCP storage requirements:

- In-memory map per MCP session
- Same record shape keyed by `reqId`

### Claim behavior

Claim action must:

1. Load context by `reqId`.
2. Call claim endpoint (`GET /auth/:reqId` with header `x-aura-claim-secret`).
3. Decrypt `encryptedToken` with the stored key material.
4. Activate token by scope:
   - `one_shot_read`: bind transient token to `reqId`
   - `session_token`: set active session token

Claim output must always return deterministic status (`claimStatus`) and retry readiness (`retryReady`).
- Claim HTTP `403` must map to deterministic `errorCode: "claim_invalid_secret"` (invalid/mismatched claim secret), not `claim_rejected`.

### Retry behavior

Retry action must include `reqId`:

- CLI: `--reqId <reqId>`
- MCP: `reqId` argument

Resolver rules:

- If `reqId` is present, use only token bound to that `reqId`.
- If no bound token exists, return deterministic error:
  - `errorCode: "missing_or_expired_claim"`
- Do not silently fall back to session token when `reqId` is present.

One-shot lifecycle rule:

- Clear one-shot token immediately after retry request dispatch.

Consumed-claim rule:

- If `GET /auth/:reqId` is called after token claim/expiry, server returns `410` with deterministic payload:
  - `errorCode: "missing_or_expired_claim"`
  - `claimStatus: "expired"`
  - `retryReady: false`
  - `claimAction`, `retryAction`, and ordered `instructions`

### Scope semantics

`one_shot_read`:

- Intended for one read retry after approval
- Must not be promoted to session token
- Must remain short-lived and scope-bound

`session_token`:

- Activated via claim
- Reused by subsequent calls until expiry/revocation

### Explicit instruction requirement

Approval payloads must include concrete ordered steps. Example:

1. Ask human to approve: `<approveUrl>`
2. Claim now: `<exact command/tool action>`
3. Retry now: `<exact command/tool action with reqId>`

### Backward compatibility

- Keep `get_token` (MCP) available and aligned to the same typed action contract.
- Treat compatibility paths as claim executors behind `claimAction`, not separate agent decision trees.

### Validation requirements

Required behavior:

- One-shot: approve -> claim(`approved`) -> retry with `reqId` succeeds; replay fails.
- One-shot consumed claim: second claim attempt returns deterministic `410 missing_or_expired_claim` payload (not a bare error).
- One-shot missing binding: retry with `reqId` returns `missing_or_expired_claim`.
- Session token: approve -> claim(`approved`) -> retry succeeds; subsequent calls can work without `reqId`.
- Parallel approvals: `reqId` isolation prevents token mix-up.
- Every approval-required payload includes typed `claimAction`, typed `retryAction`, and explicit ordered instructions.

## Profile-Based Security (Current)

Built-in profile IDs (`v1`): `strict`, `dev`, `admin`.

See [AUTH.md — Built-in Profiles](../ai-agents-workflow/AUTH.md#built-in-profiles-v1) for the full breakdown of permissions, scopes, excluded fields, TTL, and max reads per profile.

Profile resolution (`resolveProfileToEffectivePolicy`) produces:

- expanded permissions
- `credentialAccess.read` / `credentialAccess.write`
- `excludeFields`
- `ttlSeconds`
- `maxReads`
- `effectivePolicyHash`

### Tighten-only overrides

Overrides are only allowed to reduce privilege:

- shorter TTL / fewer reads
- narrower permission scope
- narrower credential selectors
- stronger field exclusions

## Permission Enforcement (Runtime)

Runtime enforcement always applies:

- route middleware validates signature, expiry, revocation
- permission checks (`requirePermission`, `hasAnyPermission`) gate capabilities
- `admin:*` remains privileged bypass flag where explicitly required

Profile is issuance; permission enforcement is the live guardrail.

## Granular credential access controls

AuraMaxx supports fine-grained secret governance:

- `secret:read` and `secret:write` route gating
- credential selectors:
  - `agent:agent`, `agent:primary`, `agent:*`, `*`
  - `tag:<label>`
  - `cred-xxxxx`
- policy TTL and `maxReads`
- per-credential/minute rate limits
- field minimization via `excludeFields`

This means permissions can say “can read secrets,” and selectors define **where** and **what field-level data** is reachable.

### Recommended mental model

- Permissions say **action** (`read`/`write`/`totp`),
- selectors say **scope** (agent/field scope),
- TTL/limits say **time/volume**.

## Encrypted transport boundaries

- `GET /auth/connect` returns a short-lived server public key.
- `/setup` and `/unlock` accept encrypted payloads.
- Agent token claim endpoints return `encryptedToken`.
- Secret reads return ciphertext suitable to caller key material.

This prevents plaintext secrets in transit for normal operations.

## Strict mode and local auto-approve

Strict posture is preferred for high-trust environments.

Set strict local defaults:

- `trust.localProfile = strict`
- `trust.localAutoApprove = false`

Quick commands:

```bash
curl -sS -X PATCH http://localhost:4242/defaults/trust.localProfile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value":"strict"}'

curl -sS -X PATCH http://localhost:4242/defaults/trust.localAutoApprove \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value":false}'
```

## Profile creation and validation

Profiles are derived from built-ins + tighten-only overrides.

Supported override keys:

- `ttlSeconds`
- `maxReads`
- `scope`
- `readScopes`
- `writeScopes`
- `excludeFields`

Prefer preview before issuing:

- `POST /actions/token/preview`
- `auramaxx token preview --profile <id> [--profile-version v1] [--overrides '{...}']`
